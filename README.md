        GAMEPLAY
------------------------

The goal is to reach the Destiny's Sword location before enemy. Once player reaches the sword player will win the game and turn back to "Main Menu" screen.

After entering the game from "Destiny Run.exe", user will see "Main Menu" screen. In this screen there are 3 buttons which are "Play", "Settings", "Exit". "Settings" button is for future development. "Play" button directly goes to next scene which is the Game scene. "Exit" button hovers to two more buttons which are "Yes" and "No" for quitting the game.

In "Game" scene, player has the first turn and there will be a dice each round at user's perspective. The dice will stop after player presses "Space" button from his/her keyboard. After dice stops, player will have movement range according to number that came from the dice. ***Be careful, once you press a tile to move, player's turn will end***. After player's turn ends, the turn will automaticly passes to AI (Enemy). AI movements and dice conditions are random and automaticly done by game and player must wait to do any interaction until it's his/her turn. 

There's also in game pause-menu where player can access it by pressing the "Escape" button from his/her keyboard. It can opened and closed via button or after it's opened it can be also closed by pressing "Resume" button in the UI. "Restart" button will restart the level and start from the beginning. "Main Menu" button will switch the screen from "Game" to "Main Menu". "Audio" toggle is for mute/unmute audio of the game.

That's all, have fun!!!
